#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) o(n^3-1)

b) o(n^2) this is an example of  nested loop. n input is being looped over 2 times every single run

c) o(bunnies) ===> o(n)


## Exercise II
Binary serach would be a great strategy. The algorithm runs in O(log n) time.

- I will create a list of floors with range upto n
- Get the midpoint by dividing by 2 and seperate the list in halves.
- Then i will have low to mid and mid to high
- I would conduct a test by dropping an egg or eggs from the midpoint
- I will check to see if they broke 
- If so, I try out low to mid. then mid to high
- Then I will be able to find f by notating the floor that the egg broke at.
